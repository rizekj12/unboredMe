An app that helps kill some time!

Description: The Bored App is an application that helps find random activites to do on a day where there seems to be nothing to do. This app will allow a user to find an activity to do based on type, number of participants or just randomnly chosen. The user can also enter in an activity they think of and can hold it in a "featured activity" component on the main page. This app will generate random activites from a large API of activites.

Code Snippet:

{
	"activity": "Learn Express.js",
	"accessibility": 0.25,
	"type": "education",
	"participants": 1,
	"price": 0.1,
	"link": "https://expressjs.com/",
	"key": "3943506"
} 


MVP: 

-create a page which randomnly generates an activity with a button.

-create divs on the home page which leads user to search for an activity based on type of activity or number of participants which are separate components

-display a div with a "create activity" option that diplays a component allowing users to create an activity and have it featured on the homepage under a "featured activity component"

Post MVP:

allow users to save certain activities on their own personal list
